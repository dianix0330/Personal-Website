Fuzu Job Search Platform

There are over 1,500,000 million job seekers on Fuzu, (Syndicode)
We used ElasticSearch technology to return search results immediately.
The platform also uses machine learning to evaluate candidate's skills and experience.

This way, the employwer can immediately assess the relevance of each submitted application.

We implement server side rendering by using NextJS to increase the website's load speed and optimized the pages. It's avearge loading speed is currently less than 2 seconds.

Backend side was Ruby on Rails.


When we started building Fuzu from scratch, React was our very obious choice.
React is pretty good at creating Single Page Applications, but Google crawlers find it difficult to index and fully process the JS of our app.
This will start affecting our SEO, you know for the job platform like Fuzu, the user's content is Hero.

(We wanted user's profile should be in the top 5 search results when someone is client is looking for talent.)

We all know that SEO takes a resonable amount of time to build, and we lost our initial couple of months by not getting indexed and ranked enough by Google.
